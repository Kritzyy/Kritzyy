# About me:
_"We create games with feelings in mind and let others play them, only to confirm we can understand those feelings and invoke them in others."_

I am Nick Hellstern, 21 years, a student at Fontys Hogeschool ICT in Tilburg, working on Game Design. I love the Japanese culture and I am a big cat person.
